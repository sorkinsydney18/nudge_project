## Data

There were 216 total responses. Of those particpants 185 answered they are not a recruited athlete and 20 answered they are a recruited athlete. Particpants were randomly selected to recieve the intervention. Of all 216 participants 109 people were in the control group. They answered this question: "In your opinion, how difficult is it for recruited athletes to be admitted to Harvard compared to other prospective students?". I coded the following answers: (-2) Much easier, (-1) slightly easier, (0) no difference, (1) slightly harder, (2) much harder. 
  

107 people recieved the intervention. They received this blurb before answering the same question above: "Did you know that every recruited student athlete is evaluated through an Academic Index? Harvardâ€™s Academic Index is 220 out of 240 which equates to ~1520 SAT/ 34 ACT and 4.0 GPA. Ivy League rules state that Harvard Athletics must have an average no lower than one standard deviation below 220."



```{r summary stats}
#average answer of control group without athletes

avg_control <- cleaned_survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(athlete), athlete == 0)  %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(response, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(avg)

#average answer of treated group

avg_treated <- cleaned_survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(athlete), athlete == 0) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(response_treated, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(avg)

avg_treated - avg_control
#average answer for control just athletes (check sample size, 8)

avg_ath_control <- cleaned_survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(athlete), athlete == 1) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(response, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(avg)

#average answer for treatment just athletes (check sample size, 12)

avg_ath_treated <- cleaned_survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(athlete), athlete == 1) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(response_treated, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(avg)

```

## Results
  
*For data analysis I excluded respondents who indicated they are a recruited athlete*
    
The mean response for the control group is `r avg_control`. This means the control group tended to answer "Slightly Easier". 

The mean response for the treated group is `r avg_treated`. The treated group also tended to answer "Slightly Easier". The difference between the control and treated group is `r avg_treated - avg_control`. This indicates the intervention may have backfired, causing respondents to answer more negatively (towards "Much Easier").
